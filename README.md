# SMHS-Schedule-Backend
The backend server driving SMHS Schedule app, uses Python Selenium to scrape the school website and feed the data to the app. Currently only the announcements API endpoint is being used, with the grades API endpoint deprecated as all grades fetching is now done on the client side to avoid potential sec.urity concerns and better protect user's privacy.
